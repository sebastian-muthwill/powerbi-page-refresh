# Power Bi page refresh

I have been searching for a way how to display a Power Bi report on a monitor or kiosk in fullscreen and refresh the page frequently. And found some bread crumbs which lead to this solution. This HTML page embeds Power Bi reports in an iframe and refreshs them by a given time. But wait, there is more! It is also possible to embed more then one report or page of a report and show so different pages.
